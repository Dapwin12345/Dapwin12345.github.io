I taught myself C# and the Unity game engine off youtube, and created some tiny games, two of which you can play right now! Unfortunately, due to the recent problems with unity, I do not trust it anymore, so I am in the process of learning the Godot game engine.</div></div><div class="S4" id="decorskill"><p id="TITLETITLE">Html & Css</p><div id="skillDescription">I have created many functional websites, however not published any, except this one.</div></div><div class="S5" id="decorskill"><p id="TITLETITLE">javascript</p><div id="cube"></div><div id="skillDescription">Along with html & css, comes learning javascript.

Built overnight, powered by Supabase, Svelte and a lot of coffee. Also on Github it doesn't show my contributions, I don't know why, but I was in charge of the frontend design<br><a href="https://github.com/Grimgrams/pied-piper">Check it out here.</a><br></p></div><div id="PRO4" class="decor-pro"><p id="ProTitle">TheDarwin</p><p>This website itself is one of my personal projects too!

Game development combines a bunch of fun topics.. such as programming, art, physics, story-telling and world building. It’s definitely one of my favourite creative outlets, and it’s been a while since I’ve done it. Due to what Unity has recently done, I'm trying to learn the Godot game engine and get back to making games!</p></div><div class="schoolAs"><p>Here are some of my school assignments which I think are pretty well done.</p><div>Religion 12: <a href="religion ISU-1-1.pdf" download>Science Impact On Relgion Essay ISU</a></div><br><div>Religion 12: <a href="ReligionChap2.pdf" download>Naturalism Essay</a></div><br><div>Physics 11: <a href="NEWPanFlute Formal Lab-1.pdf" download>Panflute ISU</a></div><br><div>Physics 11: <a href="NEW SPEED OF SOUND FORMAL LAB.pdf" download>Speed Of Sound Formal Lab</a></div><br></div><div id="lastFiles"><p>Resume: N/A</p><p>Cover Letter: N/A</p><p>Email: <a href="mailto:darwind8896@gmail.com">darwind8896@gmail.com</a></p><p>Github:</p></div></div></body></html>
